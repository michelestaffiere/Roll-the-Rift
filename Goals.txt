MVPs

1)  Call the data dragon api 2 times. obtain the    champions object and the items object. 
    1.b)  pass the champion object and the Item object to the randomizer component  for breaking down the data further to something usable for the purpose of the app. 

2) onClick of a button > randomly select 1 champion and 6 items (that can actually be used by the selected champion) from the objects.

3) display the champion img and 6 item imgs to the page. 


--------------------------------------------------

Stretch Goals ( no particular order to implement)

1)  on hover of the item img's display item stats / effects / gold cost

2) add persistance with either api or localstorage.
    2.b) the user can save a load out they liked / had fun with and when they revisit the page the app will either check local storage or firebase with the user's key to see if they have anything saved. if data is found it is pulled and generated onto the page in a seperate component.

3) add random rune selection

4) add random summoner spell selection (ensure the spell can be used in the selected game mode)

5) add Win Loss component (simple counter, completes a calcualtion and shows the winrate % of a session.)
    5.b) if win loss added > add persistance to it similar to load out persistance (1)
